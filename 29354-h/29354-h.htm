<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Marc Polder</span>, Resident Comptroller
of Torran, strolled idly
down the dusty littered path that
passed for a street. In the half-light
of the pint-sized moon overhead
the town looked almost romantic.
One day, when civilization
had at last been brought to these
Asteroid bases, memory would
make Torran heroic. But now,
with the fact before the eyes, it
was merely dirty and squalid.
Only the scum of the Solar System
called it home.</p>

<p>Idly Marc Polder pushed a
swinging door aside and entered
what passed on Torran for a
restaurant. Pushing his way
through the tables until he saw his
only aide, Female Personnel
Manager Lee Treynor, he sat
down.</p>

<p>"What's new?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not a thing." But for a certain
softness of voice and curve of unmade-up
lips, Lee could have
passed for a boy. Her light hair
was short, she wore a man's
coveralls. She added, "Only the
usual murder, arson and brigandage
that you don't want to hear
about."</p>

<p>"Don't let such trifles get you
down," said Marc with a crooked
half-smile.</p>

<p>"I'm fed up," the girl said
shortly. "I must have been still
wet behind the ears when I agreed
to come out here two months ago.
I thought I was going to help
establish a place where decent
people could live and work. So
far I've just watched my boss
swig Venerian swamp beer with
the worst elements in town, and
do nothing about the lawlessness
that runs riot all over the place."</p>

<p>"Look, lady," Marc answered
gently, "I certainly admire those
lofty sentiments of yours. I admit
they are maybe what ought to be.
But the way I see it they just
don't fit the facts. Out here the
Federation space fleet is supposed
to be the big stick. Only right
now it's off playing mumbly-peg
with the Venerians.</p>

<p>"The Big Wheels seem to think
there'll be a shooting war in a
couple of months. There's only
three or four destroyers left in
the whole damn Asteroid Belt.
And without the big stick behind
me I'm not hankering to commit
suicide by looking for trouble."</p>

<p>Marc smiled again ruefully.
"What I can do I try to do," he
added with sudden earnestness.
"I figure the most important thing
is to protect the Asteroid Development
Company so they can
buy the nuclear ore the Astrodites
bring in. Without that ore the
Federation's going to be in a hell
of a fix if it actually does come
to war. And along with that
there's the matter of guarding the
stuff the Navy's got stored here."
He waved toward the Navy warehouse
that could be seen outside
the window.</p>

<p>"Listening to and fraternizing
with the characters you call the
biggest crooks in town," the comptroller
went on with a shrug, "I've
a chance at getting tipped off in
advance to anything that may
make trouble for our interests. As
long as I ignore their rackets they
accept me in their midst, talk
freely with me around. And it's a
hell of a lot easier to stop something
when you know the score
beforehand."</p>

<p>The young woman's lips parted
as if she seemed about to say
something. Then they closed in a
thin line. Obviously she was not
happy with Marc Polder's explanation.
She was too young to
be willing to compromise her
ideals, no matter how potent the
logic of necessity.</p>

<p>She was about to leave the
table when the shrill screams of a
distant whistle sliced through the
noise of the crowd. Voices broke
off in mid-sentence and bodies
froze into immobility. As the
siren's piercing tones faded the
restaurant's customers looked at
one another in silent terror. Then,
as the shock wore off and unanswered
questions were beginning
to fly, a man suddenly ran
in through the revolving doors.</p>

<p>"Raiders!" he gasped. "The
listening gear's picked up a signal
that's not from any Astrodite or
destroyer. Signal Corps figures it's
a pirate!"</p>

<p>There was a mad rush for the
doors and seconds later the place
was empty except for Marc
Polder, still sitting calmly at the
table drinking his beer, and Lee
Treynor who sat watching him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"
she finally asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. What <i>can</i> I
do?" Marc said.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" the girl exploded.
"Are you just going to
sit there guzzling beer while
pirates take over the town?" She
stared at him incredulously.</p>

<p>"What do you suggest I do?"
the comptroller asked. "We
haven't anything to fight with.
There's no way we can get help.
As far as I can see there's nothing
we <i>can</i> do&mdash;not yet anyway." He
calmly lifted his glass.</p>

<p>"You mean we're just going to
<i>sit</i> here?" the girl gaped.</p>

<p>"Sure. The others left to hide
their money and valuables. I've
got nothing to hide."</p>

<p>"What about that stuff the
Navy has cached in their warehouse?"
Lee asked. "That new
rocket fuel their destroyers use
when they need a little extra push.
Isn't that worth hiding?"</p>

<p>"The hyper-degenerate-thorium,
you mean? I'd like to hide that
somewhere," Marc conceded.
"But where do you hide ten tons
of stuff in five minutes? Besides,
it wouldn't do the raiders any
good. Too hot. It'll burn out
their jets. They'd go up like an
A-bomb two minutes after they
threw it on. They know that.
Only thing they could do with it
is sell it to Venus. Not that that
would be bad. Shortage of
H.D.T.'s may be the chief reason
why there's been no war started
yet. But for now there's nothing
you and I can do." Calmly he lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Of course," he went on, smiling,
"we <i>could</i> bum a ride out
with some of the company men.
No doubt they're all hightailing
it away from here in their space-buggies."</p>

<p>"I'm surprised," Lee said with
a trace of sarcasm, "that you're
not doing just that, leaving me
and the other women to the
beasts!"</p>

<p>Marc eyed her unblinkingly.
"You know as well as I do that
most of the females on this
asteroid take pirates in their stride.
They might even welcome a
change of partners. As for you"&mdash;he
paused&mdash;"you stick close to
me and keep your pretty mouth
shut. I think we'll manage somehow."</p>

<p>In silence they walked back to
the comptroller's office.</p>

<p>"Marc," Lee said as they
entered, "what about the new
radar? Maybe we could get a
message out with it, in code or
something."</p>

<p>"What?" Marc turned, astonished.
"You want to play our
only hole-card on an off-chance
like that? There aren't more than
four or five people here who even
know it's been set up on the other
side of the asteroid. There's
hardly a chance the raiders will
find out about it. And you want
to blast the news at them!" He
looked disgusted.</p>

<p>The girl said stubbornly, "You
can't just give up without a fight.
And that's our only weapon."</p>

<p>"Look," Marc said grimly,
"that's only a second-hand
destroyer radar, so it wouldn't
carry far. No. I'm not going to
use it on any such harebrained
scheme as that. And if you
breathe a word about it I'll take
you apart." He added with a
faint smile, "Not that <i>that</i>
wouldn't be a pleasure."</p>

<p>Looking at him she knew he
meant the tender joke and the
knowledge helped her.</p>

<p>"I think," Marc went on after
a moment, "I'd better warn the
boys over on the radar project or
they might accidentally start it up
while the raiders are here." He
closed the door as he went into
the inner office to make the call.</p>

<p>A moment later he emerged and
studied the still angry girl through
half-closed eyes. She blushed
under his scrutiny, said coldly,
"What's the matter? Afraid I'm
not attractive enough for our
visitors?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "You could do
with a mite of padding here and
there. But I was thinking the
other way, as a matter of fact. It's
a pity you don't have a small
mustache."</p>

<p>"You don't have to insult me!"
Lee cried bitterly. "I'm <i>glad</i> I'm
thin!"</p>

<p>"I'm not insulting you," Marc
said mildly. "I even wish you
were a bit skinnier. It's the plump
girls our guests are going to be
looking at first. Remember now&mdash;you
stick right with me and
keep your mouth shut, d'you
hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear," she said shortly. But
he could see the fear she was
trying to hide and he knew she
was honestly frightened for the
first time in her adult life. She
said, "What will they&mdash;be like?"</p>

<p>"If it's John Mantor, and I
suspect it is, they'll be rough,"
Marc informed her. "He's a tough
ex-pilot who got bounced off
Space Patrol and turned outlaw.
He seems to hold a grudge
against the whole human race.
If it's one of the others&mdash;it may
be a lot worse."</p>

<p>"I don't see why outlaws are
allowed to exist at all," she said.</p>

<p>Marc sighed, shook his head.
"A lot of people have felt that
way over a lot of pirates over a
lot of eras. But somehow they
keep turning up."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the space-scarred
pirate ship had made a
rocky landing in the middle of the
small spaceport and John Mantor,
pirate chief, drove up to the comptroller's
office in a cloud of dust.
He was tall and dirty and thin and
tough. "Which one of you is the
comptroller?" he demanded, as
he faced Marc Polder and Lee
Treynor.</p>

<p>"I am," Marc said, not rising
from behind the desk.</p>

<p>"Then you're the guy responsible
for any trouble here," Mantor
said. "So I'm going to tell you
how to avoid trouble." His
brutally scarred face twisted into
a grin.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of loot around
here. I'm not going to ask you
where it is. My boys can take
care of that matter. But there's
also the Navy warehouse. Maybe
we won't know what some of the
stuff in there is for, so you're
going to tell us."</p>

<p>Mantor leaned across the desk,
his eyes as hard and cold as
chips of duratite. "And if you
won't, there's going to be trouble
and you'll be it&mdash;you and your
friend here."</p>

<p>Marc sat impassively, meeting
the hard-eyed gaze. "That warehouse
is government property,"
he said. "So far, there's only
piracy against you. But if you
raid that building you're going
to be the personal problem of the
Navy. If I were you I'd leave it
alone."</p>

<p>"You let me worry about that,"
said Mantor.</p>

<p>"Besides," Marc went on, "I
don't see what good the stuff in
that warehouse can be to you.
There's little of cash value in
there. And I doubt if you can
use any of the parts on your ship."</p>

<p>"That could be," Mantor replied.
"But on the other hand,
maybe we can find a market for
certain items." He smiled coldly.
Watching, Lee knew he referred
to Venus. She sat perfectly still,
praying for him not to notice her.</p>

<p>Mantor spread his hands on the
desk, a look of hatred and ferocity
on his face. "What I want to
know is&mdash;are you or are you not
going to cooperate? And I want
to know fast."</p>

<p>"Don't get me wrong," Marc
said softly. "I'm not telling you
what to do or what not to do.
But that warehouse is the thing
I'm here to protect. And if I were
to agree to help you, the Navy
would be after me, too. So I've
got to say to hell with you."</p>

<p>John Mantor rocked back on
his heels, hooking his thumbs in
his belt. A slow smile spread
over his face. "Okay," he said. "I
think I get what you mean. So I
guess we got to work you over.
And we'll do it where there aren't
any outside witnesses."</p>

<p>Marc grinned back at him.</p>

<p>Lee was puzzled. It took her
a moment to realize that the grins
sealed a contract between the two
men. Marc would cooperate if he
were beaten up enough first to
satisfy a later investigation&mdash;but
not too severely for his own comfort!</p>

<p>Lee found it difficult to hide
her contempt. She stared at her
hands, clenched in her lap, and
waited for Mantor to leave.</p>

<p>The looting and destruction
were well under way an hour later
when a couple of Mantor's men
joined their chief, who stood with
a somewhat bruised Marc Polder
and an unharmed but furious Lee
Treynor. Between them they carried
a small, obviously heavy box.</p>

<p>"You know what this stuff is,
boss?" one of the men asked.
"They got a hundred or a
hundred-fifty boxes like this in
there." He nodded at the Navy
warehouse.</p>

<p>They set the box down and
Mantor flung back its lid. It was
filled with small grey pellets.
Mantor picked up a handful and
stood fingering them.</p>

<p>"Looks like rocket fuel," he
said. "Only I've never seen any
this color. And it's too heavy,
also." He turned to the comptroller.
"<i>You</i> tell me what it is."</p>

<p>Marc shrugged. "I don't know.
It's a Navy secret."</p>

<p>Mantor's eyes glinted. Without
warning his fist flew out, sent the
comptroller sprawling in the dust
where he lay stunned. Lee's hands
flew to her mouth barely in time
to suppress a cry.</p>

<p>After a few moments Marc
rolled over slowly and pushed
himself painfully to a sitting position.
He looked up at Mantor who
stood watching him coldly, his
fist flexing.</p>

<p>The comptroller licked his lips
and looked around at the several
men who stood watching, their
faces impassive. "Okay," he said
in a none-too-steady voice. "I'll
tell you. You'd find out anyway
from the files."</p>

<p>"Cut the alibis and give," Mantor
growled.</p>

<p>"Keep your shirt on." Marc's
voice indicated he was regaining
control of himself. "It's H.D.T.&mdash;Hyper-Degenerate-Thorium&mdash;the
stuff the destroyers use to get
extra push."</p>

<p>Mantor roared his glee. "Pack
it aboard, boys&mdash;<i>all</i> of it! And
put it where it will be handy,
just in case."</p>

<p>This was it, Lee thought as she
stood by, watching&mdash;the final
bitter pill. Mantor had as much
as told them he was working for
Venus. And the H.D.T. was all
Venus needed to be ready for war&mdash;a
war that might well blast
civilization from the Solar System.
Strange that so much should
depend upon one man; tragic that
the one man was a weakling.</p>

<p>With an effort Lee forced herself
to be fair. It might have done
no good to lie, she conceded. But
anyone with even a normal
amount of simple courage would
have tried.</p>

<p>It was about two hours later
when the siren went off again like
a banshee wailing to a low-hanging
moon. Men came running
from all directions, shouting questions
at the tops of their voices.</p>

<p>A midget auto came skidding
down the pirate ship's ramp, its
driver standing on the accelerator.
The car knifed through the swirling
crowd, barely missing several
people, and skidded to a dusty
stop directly in front of Mantor.</p>

<p>"<i>Radar signal!</i>" the driver
yelled. "The search receiver
picked up a signal that sounds like
a destroyer's radar. It suddenly
came in strong. Probably sneaked
up on us from behind that damn
moon. It's coming in fast and
braking hard!"</p>

<p>There was a mad scramble as
the looters raced for their ship.
Heavy-handed horseplay was forgotten.
They knew they were
helpless against a Navy destroyer.
Their only hope lay in a fast
getaway. Seconds could easily
spell the difference between safety
and defeat.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes the
ship's locks were sealed and they
fired off. As the flames roared
out and the huge ship lifted
swiftly it was obvious that they
were throwing on all the fuel
their jets could take.</p>

<p>Marc Polder had faded back
into the crowd at the first sound
of the siren. As he stood watching
the blastoff Lee joined him,
hands in her pockets, looking
more than ever like a boy.</p>

<p>"Maybe my idea of asking for
help wasn't so far-fetched," she
said quietly. "Maybe the patrol
might have been here in time.
Maybe you wouldn't have had to
tell them about the H.D.T."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Marc answered without
turning his eyes from the
dwindling point of reddish light
high in the dark sky.</p>

<p>"And just by way of keeping
the record straight," the girl went
on in a voice that began to rasp,
"you know as well as I do that
the files don't list any H.D.T.
It's under a code name."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Marc replied in a
noncommittal tone.</p>

<p>The point of light in the sky
suddenly turned blue. Lee was
staring at it too, now. And she
knew also what the change of
color meant. Mantor had started
to use the new fuel!</p>

<hr />

<p>Suddenly there was a blinding
flash. Lee cried out and staggered
back, covering her eyes. Marc,
who had closed his eyes when the
color change came, took hold of
the girl's arm.</p>

<p>"I told you what would happen
if they used the stuff," he said
gently. "It's too hot for their jet
chambers. It melts the walls. A
lot of gas piles up in the tubes.
The pressure pushes the fire back.
And when it gets shoved back into
the recoil chamber and you lose
the protective layers of cold gas
there&mdash;well, then you've got to
look for your ship with an
ionization gauge!</p>

<p>"I told you all that long ago.
The trouble is, you're too idealistic,
Lee. That's not the same as
<i>having ideals</i>. I admire ideals&mdash;I
might even confess to a few of
my own. But <i>you</i> don't stop to
figure out just what your ideals
are&mdash;exactly what you're fighting
for.</p>

<p>"You come to a crisis like this
one and you forget about the <i>big</i>
goal. All you see is this one
problem. And by giving them yes-or-no
answers&mdash;good or bad,
brave or cowardly&mdash;to the problem
of the moment&mdash;you may
miss a simple solution to the big
one.</p>

<p>"You've got to keep a cool
head and never forget for even a
moment exactly what it is you
want to accomplish." His voice
was gentle, and it held no rebuke.</p>

<p>"All right," said Lee unhappily,
"you win. You needn't
bother to rub in the salt. I was
going to chase you through all
the inquiry courts for this. Instead,
you got a lucky break, so I can't
do a thing. You ought to be
tarred and feathered through
every city of the Federation, but
because a destroyer happened to
stumble in here at the right time
you'll end up a hero." Her voice
caught in a sob.</p>

<p>"Oh, the destroyer," Marc replied.
"Ah, yes, that <i>was</i> lucky,
wasn't it? The only hitch is&mdash;there
wasn't any destroyer. Probably
not one within a million
miles!" He laughed as Lee turned
surprise-widened eyes toward him.</p>

<p>"What they thought was a
destroyer was the radar system on
the side of the rock, bouncing a
signal off the moon. I gave the
radar boys the word just before
Mantor dropped in on us. The
crew did a damned good job of
juggling the power and frequency
and all." He grinned. "Remind
me to buy them a beer sometime."</p>

<p>He laughed then at the girl's
expression as it changed from
bitter disillusion to something akin
to awe, close to hero-worship.</p>

<p>"And this, by the way," Polder
said, "is as good a time as any to
tell you that I'd like to see you
look like a woman, for a change.
How about changing into a dress
before we go into town. You
know, I've never seen you out of
that uniform?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, unsure of herself
now. "That will take a little
time," she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>He put hands on her slim
shoulders, gave her a gentle shove
toward her quarters. "We've got
time," he told her. "Lots of it.
But I've been waiting quite
a while."</p>
